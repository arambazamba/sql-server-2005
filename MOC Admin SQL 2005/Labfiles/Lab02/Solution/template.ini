; IMPORTANT:  THIS IS A TEMPLATE .INI FILE FOR THE SQL SERVER YUKON
; INSTALLATION, AND NOT MEANT TO BE USED "AS IS".
 
; TO USE THIS FILE FOR INSTALLING SQL SERVER:
; To use this file, you must fill in the information required for your
; installation and comment out or delete any unneeded information.
; To comment out a line, preface it with a semicolon ';'.
; To determine the information required by your installation,
; read the descriptions that are provided for each parameter.
; Refer to the online help for additional information.

; To specify this .ini file when starting setup, use the /settings
; switch on the SQL Server Yukon Setup.exe command line. This forces
; the setup program to use the data contained in this file for
; the initial settings displayed by the SQL Server Yukon Setup
; wizard. 

; Command line examples:
; 1. New standalone installation:
; a) Instance aware components:
; start /wait setup.exe /qb INSTANCENAME=MSSQLSERVER ADDLOCAL=SQL_Engine,SQL_Replication SQLACCOUNT=domain\user 
; SQLPASSWORD=thepassword 
; b) Shared components:
; start /wait setup.exe /qb ADDLOCAL=Client_components,Connectivity  
; 2. New cluster installation:
; start /wait setup.exe /qn /settings c:\settings.ini VS=YUKONVS INSTALLVS=SQL_Engine,Analysis_server INSTANCENAME=INSTANCE1 ADDLOCAL=All ADDNODE=compname1,compname2

; 3. Add/Remove features to Standalone:
; start /wait setup.exe /qb INSTANCENAME=INSTANCENAME ADDLOCAL=SQL_Replication REMOVE=SQL_FullText

; 4. Uninstall Standalone installation:
; start /wait setup.exe REMOVE=SQL_Engine,Analysis_Server,RS_Server,Notification_Services,SQL_DTS,Client_Components

; 5. Remote installation: 
; start /wait setup.exe /qn INSTANCENAME=MSSQLSERVER TARGETCOMPUTER=COMPNAME ADMINPASSWORD=userpassword ADDLOCAL=All SECURITYMODE=SQL SAPWD=thepassword!

; 6. Add nodes to cluster
; start /wait setup.exe qn VS=YUKONVS INSTALLVS=SQL_Engine INSTANCENAME=INSTANCE1 ADDNODE=compname1

; 7. Remove nodes from cluster
; start /wait setup.exe qn VS=YUKONVS INSTALLVS=SQL_Engine INSTANCENAME=INSTANCE1 REMOVENODE=compname1

; The following line is required

[Options]

; Name of the remote computer for remote installation. If the name of the 
; TARGETCOMPUTER is different from local computer, Setup will treat this installation 
; as remote installation. If a remote computer name is specified ADMINPASSWORD must not be 
; blank. For local installations leave this entry blank.

;TARGETCOMPUTER=

; Information for the Registration Information Dialog  
; Default: If these parameters are unspecified, the default 
; OS username and company name values for the server are used.
; Note: If names contain spaces, surround the names with quotes.

USERNAME=
COMPANYNAME=

; NOTE: For the SQL Server Yukon milestones, the following PIDKEY command is not required,
; because the PIDKEY parameter for the MSI file is preset. However, the release version
; of the SQL Server Yukon will require the PIDKEY parameter.
; Usage: PIDKEY=ABCDE12345FGHIJ67890KLMNO  (This is not an actual key value.)
; NOTE: PIDKEY cannot be used for Desktop Engine installations.
; NOTE: Do not include "-" in the PIDKEY.

;PIDKEY=

; Information for the Feature Selection Dialog.  To use the default paths do not
; specify the following parameters.
; NOTE:  If there is a space in a specified path, surround the path with quotes
; and end every path with a '\'.

; INSTALLSQLDIR is specifies the location for the instance specific binary files.  
; Default:  %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft SQL Server\
; NOTE: INSTALLSQLDIR is REQUIRED for clustered installations and must point to a local 
; drive for which the drive letter exists on all nodes in the cluster definition.

INSTALLSQLDIR=

; INSTALLSQLDATADIR specifies the location for the SQL Server data files.  
; Default; The INSTALLSQLDIR location 
; NOTE: INSTALLSQLDATADIR is REQUIRED for clustered installations and must point to a 
; shared drive which is a member of the cluster group specified for installation.

INSTALLSQLDATADIR=


; INSTALLASDATADIR specifies the location for the Analysis Services
; Data Files.  
; Default:  INSTALLSQLDIR\Data\
; NOTE: Do not use with a Virtual Server or Desktop Engine installation.  
; If Analysis Services is already installed on the computer, this parameter is ignored.

INSTALLASDATADIR=

; ADDLOCAL specifies which components to install.  If ADDLOCAL is not 
; specified, setup will fail.
; To install all components specify 'ADDLOCAL=All' on the command line.

; To install all components specify:
;   ADDLOCAL=All

; To use ADDLOCAL, provide a comma-delimited list with no spaces of the 
; features to install. For example, to install everything except the
; the Analysis Services and Report Server components, the list would be as follows:
;   ADDLOCAL=SQL_Engine,SQL_Data_Files,SQL_Replication,SQL_FullText,Notification_Services,NS_Engine,NS_Client,SQL_DTS,Client_Components,Server_tools,RS_tools,Connectivity,ProgrammingModels,DTS_Runtime,SQL_Tools90,SQL_ComputerManagement,SQL_WorkBench,SQL_Profiler90,ReplMonitor,Development_Tools,SQL_WarehouseDevWorkbench,SDK,SQL_Documentation,SQL_BooksOnline,SQL_SQLServerBooksOnline,SQL_SQLServerMobileBooksOnline,SQL_Samples,SQL_AdventureWorksSamples,SQL_AdventureWorksDWSamples,SQL_AnalysisServiceSamples,SQL_DatabaseEngineSamples,SQL_DataTransformationServicesSamples,SQL_ReportingServicesSamples

; You can also use ADDLOCAL to add components in maintenance mode.  
; For example, after performing the installation shown above, you could
; add Analysis Services by running SQL Server Setup in maintenance mode
; and specifying the following:
;   ADDLOCAL=Analysis_Server,AnalysisDataFiles,Client_Components,Connectivity

; Use the REMOVE parameter, when maintaining an install, to remove 
; components in the same manner. For example, to  remove Full-Text 
; search use the following command line:
;   REMOVE=SQL_FullText

; REMOVE can be used during maintenance to remove components from an existing
; installation or specified for a new installation where the components listed after 
; 'REMOVE=' will not be included for installation.  For example to install every 
; component except for Report Server components during a new installation specify 
; the following:
